Sure! Here’s the breakdown of the `deleteNode` function with each code segment aligned to each step in the explanation, along with tree diagrams for better visualization.

### **Step 1: Base Case and Recursive Call**

- **Code**:
  ```cpp
  if (root) 
      if (key < root->val) root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);  
      else if (key > root->val) root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
  ```
- **Explanation**: This code checks whether to move left or right in the tree to find the node with the `key` value.
- **Diagram**: Starting from root, we look for the node with the value `10` (target key).
  
  **Tree**:
  ```
         10
        /  \
       5    15
      / \     \
     3   7     18
  ```

Since `key` (10) matches `root->val`, we move to the next steps.

---

### **Step 2: Node with No Children**

This step doesn't apply in our example since the node `10` has both left and right children. If we were at a node with no children, we would delete it by returning `NULL`.

- **Code**:
  ```cpp
  if (!root->left && !root->right) return NULL;
  ```

No tree changes occur in this step since it does not apply to our case.

---

### **Step 3: Node with One Child**

This step also doesn’t apply because node `10` has two children. However, if we encountered a node with only one child, we would replace it with its child.

- **Code**:
  ```cpp
  if (!root->left || !root->right)
      return root->left ? root->left : root->right;
  ```

No tree changes occur here as well, as this condition is also not met.

---

### **Step 4: Node with Two Children**

Since node `10` has two children, we follow this step to handle the deletion properly. Here’s how this is done:

1. **Finding the Maximum Node in the Left Subtree**:
   - **Code**:
     ```cpp
     TreeNode* temp = root->left;
     while (temp->right != NULL) temp = temp->right;
     ```
   - **Explanation**: Start at `root->left` (node `5`), then move to `5`'s right child `7`, which is the maximum node in the left subtree.
   - **Diagram**:
     ```
           10
          /  \
         5    15
        / \     \
       3   7     18
     ```

2. **Replacing Node `10` with `7`**:
   - **Code**:
     ```cpp
     root->val = temp->val;
     ```
   - **Explanation**: We replace the value of node `10` with the value `7`.
   - **Updated Tree**:
     ```
           7
          /  \
         5    15
        / \     \
       3   7     18
     ```

3. **Deleting the Node with Value `7` in the Left Subtree**:
   - **Code**:
     ```cpp
     root->left = deleteNode(root->left, temp->val);
     ```
   - **Explanation**: Now, we delete the duplicate `7` node in the left subtree. Since this `7` node has no children, we remove it by returning `NULL`.
   - **Final Tree**:
     ```
           7
          /  \
         5    15
        /       \
       3         18
     ```

---

### **Step 5: Return the Updated Root**

- **Code**:
  ```cpp
  return root;
  ```
- **Explanation**: Finally, we return the modified root of the tree after deletion is completed.

---

### **Complete Code with Explanation**:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
        // Step 1: Traverse the tree to find the node with the key
        if (root) {
            if (key < root->val) 
                root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);  // Go left
            else if (key > root->val) 
                root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key); // Go right
            else {
                // Step 2: Node with no children (leaf node)
                if (!root->left && !root->right) return NULL;
                
                // Step 3: Node with only one child
                if (!root->left || !root->right) 
                    return root->left ? root->left : root->right;
                
                // Step 4: Node with two children
                TreeNode* temp = root->left;
                while (temp->right != NULL) temp = temp->right; // Find max in left subtree
                root->val = temp->val; // Replace with max value in left subtree
                root->left = deleteNode(root->left, temp->val); // Delete the duplicate node
            }
        }
        // Step 5: Return updated root
        return root;
    }
};
```

This breakdown with diagrams for each step provides a clear view of how each part of the code contributes to the final deletion process.
